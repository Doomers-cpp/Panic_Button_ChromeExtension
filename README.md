# Panic Button - The Ultimate "Mom's Coming!" Chrome Extension
Uh-oh! Someone's sneaking up on you while you're browsing the web, and you need to hide everything FAST? Don't worry! Panic Button has got your back! With our hilarious and sneaky Chrome extension, you'll never be caught off guard again.

Panic Button is your digital superhero that swoops in to save the day when you need to vanish from the internet in the blink of an eye. Our extension is perfect for those moments when your mom, boss, or that nosy coworker suddenly appears and you just can't let them see what you're up to.

Here's how Panic Button - The Ultimate "Mom's Coming!" Chrome Extension works:

1) Press the secret keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Z) to activate the Panic Button!
2) Watch in awe as your browsing history from the past 24 hours vanishes into thin air.
3 Gasp as all your open tabs disappear faster than you can say "I wasn't doing anything!"
4) Be amazed when a predetermined (and totally innocent) tab pops up, making it look like you were doing something entirely different.
